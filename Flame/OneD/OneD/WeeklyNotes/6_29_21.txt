To-Do this week:

1)  Verify the order of the hydrogen mechanism for the current sample

	a)  Set a simple problem that runs from 0-- 1e-5.  Start with 1e-6 timestep and halve the timestep iteratively
	b)  Check this data against the reference IgnitionDelay problem data with the same step.
	
		I) If this fails, then look into the other ignition delay problem.
		II) Need to fix the printing statements and write a wrapper function.
			!) How do I even do that?
				aa) I am currently using the kokkos parser to rebuild the 



2)  Set-up debugging

	a) Start with debugging the current code
		i)  Start with simple halt at the end of the code
	b) Set up profiling
		i)  Check to see what component of the code is taking the longest
		ii) Can we figure out the grander structure of the code given this?

3)  Prepare convergence and timing plot for meeting next week for three different samples of Hydrogen.
